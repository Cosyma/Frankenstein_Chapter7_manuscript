                his shrivelled complexion and strait
                black lips.
                The different accidents of life are
                not so changeable as the feelings of hu
                man nature. I had worked hard for
                nearly two years for the sole purpose
                of infusing f life into an inanimate
                body. For this I had deprived myself of
                rest and heath health. I had desired
                it with an ardour that far exceeded
                moderation; but now that I had succeed
                ed these dreams vanished and breathless
                horror and disgust filled my heart.
                to endurebeing
                Unable the aspect of the creature I
                ^
                had created, I rushed out of the room and
                continued
                remained a long time traversing my
                bed chamber unable to compose my
                mind to sleep. At lenght s l assitude
                succeeded to the tumult I had before
                endured, and I threw myself on my
                bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek
                a feew few moments of forgetfullness.
                But it was in vain; I slept indeed but
                I was disturbed by the wildest dreams–
                in the bloom of health
                I saw Elizabeth walking in the streets of
                ^
                Ingolstadt; delighted surprised I embraced
                her but as I imprinted the first kiss
                on her lips they became lurid with
                the hue of death; her features appeared</div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-22v" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-22v-list">so hideous as He. I had gazed on him
                while unfinished; and I thought he
                was ugly then. But when those muscles
                and joints were endued with motion
                it became a thing to such as even Dante
                could never have conceived.
                I passed the night wretchedly–
                sometimes my pulses beat so quickly t a nd
                r
                ha dly that I felt the palpitation of
                ^
                every artery: At others I nearly sunk
                thro
                to the ground with languor and ex-
                treme weakness. Surely so wretched a
                X
                creature as I never before existed.
                Dreams that had been my food and
                rest for so long a space were now
                become a hell to me– I and the
                change was so rapid, the overthrow
                so complete.
                Morning — dismal and wet — at leng ht th
                dawned, and to discovered to my sleepless
                and aching eyes the church of Ingols-

                pointed to the sixthe hour. The porter
                opened the gates of the court which had
                that night been my assylum and I
                them
                issued into the streets, pacing with
                quick steps as if I ough sought to

                ing in the street would present to</div>

                the doors being opened I perceived Henry
                Clerval, who on seee seeing me instantly
                sprung out.
                "My dear Frankenstien," exclaimed he
                "How glad I am to see you; how
                that
                "fortunate you should be here at
                very
                the moment of my alighting."
                ^
                Nothing could equal my delight
                on see seing Clerval: his presence
                brought back to my thoughts my fa-
                ther, Elizabeth and all those scenes
                of home so dear to my recollection.
                I grasped his hand, and in a moment
                forgot my horror and misfortune.
                suddenly, andduring
                I felt for the first time for for
                ^
                many months, calm and serene
                joy. I welcomed my friend therefore
                in the most cordial manner
                we walked towards my colledge.
                Clerval ran on talked continued
                our mutual
                talking for some time about my
                own
                friends and his good fortune in
                being allowed to come to Ingolstadt.
                "You may believe," said he, "that
                "it was not without considerable
                "trouble that I persuaded my

                I trembled excessively: I could not
                bear to think of, far less to allude
                to the occurences of the preceeding
                night. I continued to walk theire I
                walked therefore with a quick pace,
                and we soon arrived at my colledge.
                I then reflected – and the thought made
                me shiver that the creature whom
                I had left in my appartment might
                be still there—alive and walking
                about. I dreaded to see him but I
                dreaded still more that Henry should
                behold the monsther. I therefore
                therefore

                stairs, while I darted up towards
                my own room. My hand was already
                on the lock before I recovered
                myself, when I paused and a cold
                shivering came over me. I threw
                the door open as children are accus
                tomed to do when they expect
                a spectre to stand in waiting for
                them on the other side. But
                nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully
                in – the appartment was empty, and
                my bedroon was also freed from its
                hideous guest. I could hardly belief</div>

                Poor Clerval! What must have been
                his feelings. A joy meti meeting which
                he had anticipated with such joy so
                strangely turned to bitterness. But I
                did not witness his grief for I was
                lifeless
                senseless and did not recover my

                with an anxiety that almost amount

                spark of being into the lifeless thin k g

                one in the morning, the rain pattered
                dismally against the window panes, 
                my candle was nearly burnt out, when
                by the glimmer of the half extinguish-

                and a convulsive motion agitated
                its limbs.

                wetted by the drizzling rain which poured
                from a black and comfortless sky.
                I continued walking in this manner
                for some time endeavouring by bodily
                exercise to ease the load that weighed
                upon my mind. I traversed the streets
                without any clear conception of where
                I was or what I was doing: my heart
                in the sickness of

                to look about me,

                Continueing thus, I came at lenght
                opposite to
                opposite the Inn at which the dili

                I paused I knew not why but remained
                some minutes with my eyes fixed on
                a coach that was coming towards me
                from the other end of the street.
